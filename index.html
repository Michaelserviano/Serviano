                                    My name is Michael Angelo Hamor Serviano and I'm 20 years old. I was born on May 14, 2004 in Quezon City. I'm a 2nd year college student that took Bachelor of Science in Criminology at Sorsogon College of Criminology Incorporated (SCCI).  My parents are Elmore Lagare Serviano and Charito Dogillo Hamor. My mother was working abroad as an OFW to provide a financial support for us. While my father is working at Call Center, my father has his own family but he supports us whenever we need something. I have a sister and her name is Angelica Mae Hamor. She finished her study in the course Bachelor of Science in Marketing Management at The Lewis College.


                                    Since my parents separated. I grew up with my grandparents because my mother worked abroad to support and provide for the needs of my siblings. I got used to the plain and simple life in the province here in Casiguran, Sorsogon. I used to go with my grandmother and grandmother who were harvesting rice and harvesting copra. And I also learned to plant root crops such as sweet potato, cassava and others.
                                    
                                    I also learned to be content with what we had before.
                                    
                                    I grew up with only my cousins and a few friends. Most of my friends are just my cousins. Because in our barangay, the people who live there are almost only relatives. When we were young, we used to bathe in the river in our village. And sometimes we pick coconuts and sell them to somehow help our parents.
                                    
                                    
                                    I graduated in Elementary in year 2016 at Burgos Elementary School
                                    
                                    And I graduated Senior High School in year 2023 in Casiguran Technical Vocational School and took academic with a strand Automotive.
                                    
                                    When I was in elementary and high school I was an honor student. And I love participating in school sports activities such as basketball and volleyball.
                                    
                                    When I was in elementary school, I participated in volleyball and I made it to the provincial meet competition. And I also join the boyscout of the Philippines.
                                    
                                    I also participate in the barangay games of our sk federation every time the festival comes.
                                    
                                    And every vacation I work as SPES (Special Program for Employment of Students) to provide my allowance for the coming school year and also to help reduce the cost of my mother who is helping me with my studies.
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    Since we are a broken family, my mother and father  will no longer be together. every Christmas, my sister and I go to Manila to see our father. And it takes us sightseeing and buys us gifts. While mom is abroad, she only comes home once and every time she comes home, she really makes the most of her vacation day to give us enough time to bond as a family.
                                    
                                    So now that I'm in college. I am working hard to study to payback for my mother's suffering and sacrifice in another country for my sister and I. For that, when I finish and get a job, I can also help my family, especially my grandmother and mother. And so that I can also give them the life that they deserve.

                                    Plagiarism is the act of taking someone else's work, ideas, words, or intellectual property and presenting them as your own without giving proper credit to the original source. It can occur intentionally, such as copying and pasting text, or unintentionally, like failing to cite a source correctly. Plagiarism is considered unethical and a violation of academic, professional, and creative standards because it involves dishonesty and undermines the value of original work and intellectual effort.

                                    To avoid plagiarism, always ensure you properly credit the original sources by citing them accurately, use quotation marks for direct quotes, and paraphrase ideas in your own words while still giving credit. Additionally, utilize plagiarism detection tools to double-check your work, maintain clear notes of your sources, and follow the specific citation style required for your work.

                                </h3>
                                <p>Plagiarism can be categorized into several types. **Direct plagiarism** involves copying someone else's work word-for-word without proper credit. **Self-plagiarism** occurs when an individual reuses their own previous work, such as essays or articles, without acknowledging it. **Mosaic plagiarism**, also called patchwriting, involves blending phrases or ideas from multiple sources with original content but failing to credit the sources. Lastly, **accidental plagiarism** happens when someone unintentionally neglects to cite sources properly or paraphrases incorrectly, often due to a lack of understanding of citation rules.
